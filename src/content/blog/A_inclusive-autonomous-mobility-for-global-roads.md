In the realm of self-driving cars, much attention is given to their progress in the US, Europe, and China, where companies are racing to introduce innovations like robotaxis and autonomous trucks. However, it’s vital to shift our focus and start asking fundamental questions about how we can make this technology accessible worldwide.

Self-driving cars aren’t just a tech advancement; they’re set to reshape how various industries operate, from ride-hailing to logistics and emergency services. This technology could either help reduce existing economic and social gaps or make them worse. While advanced countries are likely to see more self-driving cars in the next five to ten years, the situation for the rest of the world is uncertain.

To fully realize the benefits of this technology, we need roads exclusively for self-driving cars. But thinking about introducing this technology in countries like Mexico, India, or Ghana raises important questions.

In these countries, the needs are different from those in the US and Europe. However, we can’t ignore these nations, as neglecting them could widen economic disparities. Now is the time to ask:

How can we adjust existing designs to fit the unique needs of these countries?
What changes in business models are necessary for each region?
How can we use existing infrastructure to help these countries adopt these technologies?
Can we standardize mapping and planning to make it easier for these countries to adopt self-driving technologies?
Despite uncertainties about how this technology will develop and how regulations will evolve, it’s essential to start thinking about what’s needed. New business models will be needed for each country, but we should design products, experiences, and regulations to encourage the easy use and growth of these technologies, considering adaptable and inclusive solutions.

Sometimes, current designs focus on what designers think is best for users but may overlook the actual problems users face. For instance, the latest self-driving car designs may work well for some US cities but might not be suitable for all cities. So, it’s crucial to improve these designs to meet the diverse needs of users.

If we start thinking about these issues early in the development process, it will be cheaper and easier to create solutions that can be widely adopted. In the world of self-driving cars, forward-thinking and a commitment to inclusive development lay the groundwork for a future where technology benefits people worldwide.

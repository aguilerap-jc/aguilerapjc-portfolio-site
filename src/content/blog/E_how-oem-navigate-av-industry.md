In our exploration of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the autonomous vehicle landscape, a surge of transformative advancements spanning two decades defines the terrain. As both seasoned pioneers and new entrants propel progress, OEMs stand at a pivotal crossroads, compelled to adapt swiftly to the rapidly evolving industry.

Over the past two decades, the surge in autonomous vehicle development has thrust OEMs into the forefront of the innovation race. While industry stalwarts have long held the mantle of pioneers, the emergence of newcomers armed with digital prowess and superior software capabilities has set the stage for a challenging catch-up for some.

Efficiency in production and manufacturing has traditionally been a stronghold for most incumbents, but a shift is underway. The historical strength in production now contrasts with a longstanding weakness — software development. As demands for sophisticated software in AV systems soar, OEMs grapple with matching the agile development cycles of their digitally native counterparts.

For most automakers, the core of their business lies in the production and sale of vehicles, leading to a strategic divide between the focus on Automated Driving Assisting Systems (ADAS) — encompassing L2, L2+, and L3 systems — and the more advanced Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) or L4 Systems. The immediate efforts of the majority are directed toward ADAS, aiming for quicker integration into production vehicles to sustain market appeal, while the formidable challenges of L4 Systems, with high investment requirements and slow development, are deferred to the long term.

This strategic choice doesn’t signify a lack of interest in ADS; quite the opposite. Most OEMs are heavily invested in L4 systems due to their transformative potential for the long term. However, the slow development cycles and high production costs have prompted many OEMs to opt for a strategic investment approach. For example, General Motors is a major investor in GM Cruise, seeking to capitalize on products like supercruise developed partially with GM Cruise technology. Honda, Toyota, VW, and Ford have embraced a similar strategy, investing in companies like Cruise, Pony AI, and Argo AI.

Mercedes-Daimler takes a distinctive route, focusing on delivering L3 systems to enhance product value, primarily aligning with luxury brands given the associated costs and limited operational domain.

On the bold end of the spectrum, Tesla pioneers an in-house development approach, striving to deliver L2-L4 solutions. Currently, they have successfully rolled out L2 and L2+ solutions with promises of a future L4 system.

While OEMs continue their journey, heavy reliance on Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers for specialized solutions through Technology Licensing and Technology Suppliers becomes evident. This strategic dependency minimizes in-house development costs but introduces integration challenges.

As we navigate the complexities of OEM strategies in the AV realm, the industry is in a dynamic state of evolution. OEMs adopt diverse approaches to secure their role in the future of autonomous transportation, with technology, partnerships, and strategic investments playing pivotal roles.

In the broader context, the traditional dominance of Western brands, synonymous with successful, reliable, and prestigious vehicles, faces an unprecedented challenge from Eastward newcomers. These entrants, armed with a novel mindset and swift product development, are swiftly approaching the quality standards set by established Western brands. The pace of development poses a substantial risk to the longstanding dominance of Western brands. Faced with this challenge, some automakers are forging closer partnerships and collaborations with industry players, including automakers and Tier 1 suppliers, to match the rapid progress of these formidable newcomers.

Amidst the transformative landscape ushered in by the advent of AVs, OEMs are actively exploring avenues to diversify their portfolios, seeking to enhance their existing product offerings and venture into new territories to anticipate future market trends. While the core focus of automakers remains on vehicle production and sales, there is a growing realization of the need to envision services complementing AVs. The rise of AVs may potentially alter the traditional vehicle sales dynamics, leading automakers to contemplate a shift in their revenue streams from primarily vehicle sales to encompass areas such as maintenance, insurance, operations, and other service-oriented domains.

In conclusion, our exploration of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the autonomous vehicle landscape underscores the industry’s dynamic evolution at the nexus of tradition and innovation. As automakers grapple with the surge in autonomous vehicle development, a strategic tension emerges between immediate focuses on ADAS and long-term investments in transformative L4 Systems. The collaborative interplay with Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers reflects the industry’s adaptive nature, leveraging external expertise while navigating integration challenges.

Beyond the technological intricacies, the traditional dominance of Western brands confronts an unprecedented challenge from agile Eastern newcomers, reshaping industry dynamics. While forging partnerships becomes imperative for some to match the pace of these formidable entrants, the broader industry contemplates diversification beyond traditional vehicle sales. The rise of AVs prompts automakers to envision services and revenue streams beyond the conventional, reflecting a broader shift in the automotive landscape. Our journey continues with an exploration of Fleet Management, offering further insights into the multifaceted strategies shaping the future of autonomous vehicles. Stay tuned for our next exploration into the heart of AV business models, unraveling the distinctive role of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) (Ride Hailing/Pooling), Transport as a Service (TaaS), and Trucking in shaping the future of autonomous vehicles.

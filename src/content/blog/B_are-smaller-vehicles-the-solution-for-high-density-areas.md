In the realm of autonomous vehicles, a notable trend has emerged — designs predominantly favor larger vehicles akin to medium or large SUVs. However, the critical question lingers: Is this truly the optimal solution for high-density urban areas?

A closer examination of mobility patterns in the world’s largest and most densely populated cities reveals a reliance on smaller vehicles. Motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, and Tuk Tuks reign supreme in cities like Delhi and Jakarta, where millions of these nimble vehicles navigate crowded streets. The contrast is stark, with Delhi boasting an estimated 7.5 million motorcycles compared to 3.2 million cars, and Jakarta reporting a staggering 16 million motorcycles against 4.4 million cars. Even in public transportation, the prevalence of smaller vehicles is evident, with 114 thousand Tuk Tuks registered in Delhi compared to 100 thousand taxis.

This trend isn’t confined to Asia; it’s a global phenomenon set to intensify as urban populations burgeon. In Europe, where space constraints prevail, the adoption of compact vehicles like the Renault Twizy and Smart aligns with the need for efficient mobility solutions.

Yet, as the autonomous vehicle landscape unfolds, there’s a notable oversight — technological developments predominantly cater to larger vehicles. This approach may not be apt for intricate urban scenarios. While the technology is still in its infancy, it’s imperative to contemplate how it will navigate complex cityscapes and the business models conducive to such environments.

Enter the concept of Modular Fleets
A paradigm shift in ride-sharing that envisions the design and utilization of smaller vehicles, such as one-seaters or two-seaters, to construct larger, attachable, and detachable vehicles.

A significant hurdle in the adoption of the ride-sharing model is the mismatch between vehicle capacity and passenger preferences. Traditional ride-shares accommodate three or four passengers, yet most riders prefer solitary travel, eschewing shared journeys with strangers. Introducing a modular structure could revolutionize the ride-sharing landscape. Enabling customers to opt for solo or group rides enhances city-wide mobility efficiency.

The proposed evolution could commence gradually, focusing on the autonomy of one-seaters and two-seaters, thereby enhancing fleet swarm capabilities. The goal: optimizing vehicle resource utilization. Subsequently, exploring how these smaller vehicles can seamlessly attach or detach to form modular larger vehicles paves the way for a transformative era in urban transportation.
